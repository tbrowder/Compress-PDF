    - Changed the default DPI to 300 (from the original 150)

0.0.4  2024-02-15T20:14:56-06:00
    - Correct test t/5*t so no version controlled 
        files are modified during testing.

0.0.3  2024-02-15T17:47:00-06:00
    - Make the default behavior of sub compress to 
      quietly compress the input file as a tmp file 
      and write the compressed file to the input file
      name.
      + update docs and the compression bin files
        accordingly

0.0.2  2024-02-15T09:07:54-06:00
    - Extracted the actual compression code
        to an exported subroutine ('xompress')
        suitable for use by other modules.
    - Do not modify the input file name at
        all, but, if the output file name
        is NOT specified, strip off any
        suffix and replace it with
        '-NNNdpi.pdf'.

0.0.1  2024-02-13T15:18:32-06:00
